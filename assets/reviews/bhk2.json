Mr. Santy stays on the ground floor and he makes you feel at home, without any interference. My mom is a tea lover and he let us use the kitchen to our liking. I was skeptic about the safery before I booked the place as 4 of us were females, but it is absolutely a safe & secure environment/locality for women.",
